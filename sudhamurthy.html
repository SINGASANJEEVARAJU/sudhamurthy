<h3><u>MY OPINION</u></h3>
<p>
I’m an hour early for my meeting with Sudha Murty—all the more time to read about her accomplishments in engineering, teaching, writing and philanthropy in a coffee shop around the corner from the Infosys Foundation office in Bengaluru. When we finally meet at ten, she says I should have just come in earlier because she’s usually in her office by 6am—seven days of the week. “I work everyday, but every day is a holiday for me because I enjoy my work,” she says with a broad smile.I’m in for more surprises as I inquire about her staff. I’d supposed that an organisation that doles out crores in grants every year—this year it was a staggering 246 crore—would have at least 40 employees. It has two, and this includes 64-year-old Murty, its founder and chairman. She personally green-lights every request and travels for about 15 days a month to meet with beneficiaries in the rural hinterlands of Karnataka and the six other states in which the foundation’s parent company, Infosys, has a presence.this is an everything-she-touches-turns-to-gold sort of person one has the privilege to meet a few times in a lifetime. She was the only female student at her engineering college in Hubli. Herale classmates weren’t derisive but they certainly didn’t conceal their amusement at having a girl in their carpentry workshop. “I never missed a single class because I knew if I did no one would help me. It made me self-sufficient. It also made me talk to boys on equal terms,” she shares. She is known for her feisty letter to JRD Tata in reaction to a TELCO (now Tata Motors) job notice inviting applications for trainee engineers, where women were asked not to apply. She was subsequently hired as their first female engineer. It was here that she met her future husband, Narayan Murthy, one of the co-founders of Infosys. She likes to joke that in the early years of the company she worked in “all positions except that of the chairman.” Murty modestly underplays this and her contribution of the initial seed capital of 10,000 for what was to become one of India’s biggest corporate success stories.
